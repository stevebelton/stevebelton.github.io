### New Blog - New Tools

How the world has changed! I remember in the not too distant past I was a die hard Microsoft fan boy and everything had to be Microsoft. Everything. Of course, I still am a die hard Microsoft fan boy, I have just broadened my view of technology/competitors/apps now.

For example, a year ago my desktop would probably consist of 5 or 6 RDP sessions, Internet Explorer, PowerShell IDE, Outlook and that's pretty much it. Today I have added Google Chrome, [Atom](https://atom.io/), Sublime Text, [XShell](https://www.netsarang.com/products/xsh_overview.html), VNC Viewer, [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com), OneNote and  Visual Studio 2015. There's not a lot of room left for much else, or RAM for that matter.

Alongside this I tend to be using more of the public Internet, rather than Private Clouds. I would say I spend most of my Internet time on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), the [Azure Documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/) site, [Azure Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

Most of this change of toolset is down to a change of job and a change of requirements to do that job. I have gone from working for a Service Provider doing Private Cloud implementations to working for a Systems Integrator providing architecture and technology sessions on Microsoft Azure.

I used to write documentation in Microsoft Word. I find it easier and actually more fun(!) to write it now using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - using the Atom editor as it is by far the best. Having said that I also use [Classuer](http://classeur.io/). Not so much to write Markdown but to preview and export to PDF or styled HTML.
