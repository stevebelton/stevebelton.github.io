        <h3>New Blog - New Tools</h3>
        <p>How the world has changed! I remember in the not too distant past I was a die hard Microsoft fan boy and everything had to be Microsoft. Everything. Of course, I still am a die hard Microsoft fan boy, I have just broadened my view of technology/competitors/apps now.</p>
        <p>For example, a year ago my desktop would probably consist of 5 or 6 RDP sessions, Internet Explorer, PowerShell IDE, Outlook and that's pretty much it. Today I have added Google Chrome, Atom, Sublime Text, XShell, VNC Viewer, Azure Storage Explorer, OneNote and Visual Studio 2015. There's not a lot of room left for much else, or RAM for that matter.</p>
        <p>Alongside this I tend to be using more of the public Internet, rather than Private Clouds. I would say I spend most of my Internet time on the Azure Portal, the Azure Documentation site, Azure Resource Explorer and GitHub.</p>
        <p>Most of this change of toolset is down to a change of job and a change of requirements to do that job. I have gone from working for a Service Provider doing Private Cloud implementations to working for a Systems Integrator providing architecture and technology sessions on Microsoft Azure.</p>
        <p>I used to write documentation in Microsoft Word. I find it easier and actually more fun(!) to write it now using Markdown - using the Atom editor as it is by far the best. Having said that I also use Classuer as a Chrome App. Not so much to write Markdown but to preview and export to PDF or styled HTML.</p>
