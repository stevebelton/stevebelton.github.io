### Goodbye Windows.
I decided a few weeks ago that it was time to ditch Windows as my operating system of choice. I might work for Microsoft but the good thing about the new Microsoft is that we are all for personal choice. Don't get me wrong, I will still be using Microsoft technology but now it will be more Cloud focussed, specifically Microsoft365 or Azure.

My day to day job doesn't rely on anything that I can't run outside of Windows, with one exception... Skype for Business. Until that changes, my laptop will remain a Windows based operating system. For now :-)

Working with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) means I get to spend a lot of time interfacing with it either via a CLI or programatically via REST APIs, ARM Templates or Go/C#/Python. I'm going to go through the steps I did to configure my fresh **Ubuntu 18.04** installation.
